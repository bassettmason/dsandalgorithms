# InseritonSort
Code: InsertionSort

## Challenge
Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
I'm going through the array one at a time and if it is smaller than I am moving it forward until it isn't smaller than the previous value. I keep doing this until the end.

## Solution
Time: O(N)
Space: O(N)
