# FizzBuzzTree 

Code Challenge 17
## Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
iterate Bf except preventing doubles and endless iteration by using two queues to keep track of todo nodes and done nodes.

### Space Efficiency
O(1)

### Time Efficiency:
O(n)
